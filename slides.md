## Improving The ASDI Experience

---
ASDI's organic, decentralized approach has worked great in several aspects.

- Minimal gatekeeping lowers the barrier of entry for data providers.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Gives large federal data providers like NOAA a space for experimentation.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- As intended, it has truly democratized access to planetary scale data.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---
But the same aspects that make it successful also reduce its effectiveness

- Limited centralized oversight leads to a lack of focus on important thematic areas.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Lack of standardization reduces data interoperability for data users.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- The lack of a centralized indexing and search inteface makes data discovery and fusion impossible for data users.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---
### How can we improve the ASDI experience for the data community?
---
### Adopt a common metadata standard.
---
![STAC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radiantearth/stac-site/master/images/logo/stac-030-long.png)
---
STAC is a community driven standard for metadata and metadata APIs.

Rather than originating with a standards body like OGC, STAC evolved from industry and community members who had immediate, common problems to solve.

---
Development Seed has been involved with STAC since its inception.

We've built both the main reference implementations of the API standard as well as suite of tooling for working with the metadata specification.
---
The bulk of our projects are built on the STAC specification and a common set of open source libraries we build and maintain.
---

<!-- .slide: data-background-color="white" -->
Most relevant to this project is our work building the API infrastructure for Microsoft's Planetary Computer
![Planetary Computer](https://staging.dev.element84.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-01-at-5.13.58-PM-1024x255.png)
---
The Planetary Computer obviously runs on Azure.

But the bulk of the NASA projects we build use STAC and the same suite of libraries deployed on AWS.

---
When used together we call this suite of libraries eoAPI.

It serves 3 main purposes
- Store metadata for data files in a durable database.
- Serve this metadata in a standard, searchable API that a wide variety of clients can utilize.
- Provide a standard API that allows dynamically visualizing data files, and analysis optimized access. 
---
The eoAPI suite is built from 3 libraries
- pgSTAC: An optimized Postgres schema to index and search large scale STAC collection
- stac-fastapi: An OGC Features API compliant FastAPI application for metadata search
- titiler-pgstac: a TiTiler extension for pgSTAC for large scale dynamic mosaic for STAC data
---
### How have we realized this vision for ASDI?
---
### Step 1 - Infrastructure
---
### [cdk-pgstac](https://github.com/developmentseed/cdk-pgstac)

To provide an easy entrypoint and capture best practices we built a reusable CDK construct to package all of the API infrastructure into a single deployment.

---
Now we have a central API where data providers can publish standard metadata for all of the datasets they manage.
---
### Step 2 - Enable Data Providers

- Give them easy tools to turn their domain specific knowledge into pipelines for creating cloud-native formats and metadata.
- Run these pipelines automatically at scale.
---
### [Stactools](https://github.com/stactools-packages)

The community has been capturing product format specific information and transformations in a set of standard packages called stactools.
---
### [ASDI Pipelines](https://github.com/developmentseed/aws-asdi-pipelines)
- Data providers and the community build a stactools package for their dataset (in many cases these already exist from our work on Planetary Computer).
- Data providers use common AWS configurations on the buckets they manage (SNS Topics and Inventories).
- Using these, data providers can create pipeline which will automatically deploy infrastructure that monitors the SNS topic (and parses the inventory) to create cloud-native formats and metadata and ingest them into the API.

A quick example set of slides

---

Checkout `slides.md` to see how they were written.

---

## Navigate vertically

Grouping tabs vertically is a good way to discuss a single idea

_hint: press <kbd>↓</kdb>_<!-- .element: class="small" -->

--

This slide appears below the first slide

_hint: press <kbd>→</kdb>_<!-- .element: class="small" -->

---

## Navigate horizontally

This slide appears to the right of the first slide

---

Go Big<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

---

Press <kbd>ESC</kbd> to see overview

--

Press <kbd>S</kbd> to open speaker view.

You can even include notes that only the presenter can see!

<!-- Presenter notes are specified by anything written below a line that starts with "NOTE: " -->

NOTE: This is only visible to the presenter.

Drag this tab to a different window or screenshare the other tab. When you change slides on this presenter-view tab, the other tab with audience focused tabs will change as well.

--

Press <kbd>?</kbd> to see other keyboard shortcuts.

## Fragment transitions

Fade in <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Fade out <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-out" -->

Highlight red <!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-red" -->

Fade in, then out <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-out" -->

Slide up while fading in <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->

NOTE: See more about fragment transitions here: https://revealjs.com/fragments/

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

## Code

```js[|4|4,8-9|15,19-20]
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

function SecondExample() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
